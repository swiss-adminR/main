adminR: R in Swiss Official Statistics

## What we're about

This group connects R users within Swiss public administration and related institutions. Our goal is to foster networking, share experiences, and explore diverse applications of R in public statistics.
Meetups are held semi-annually, featuring talks and informal networking opportunities.


## Remote vs. On-Site

Usually, there is no remote participation, for the following reasons:

- Setting up a reliable hybrid participation system turned out to be impossible or impractical for many hosts.

- AdminR is primarily a networking event, and we encourage in-person participation to maximize interaction. The Ap√©ro following the presentations is a key part of this!

- If you can't attend, we publish all presentation slides in this repository so you can get an idea of the topics covered.


## Language

Presentations are usually in English, French, or German.
